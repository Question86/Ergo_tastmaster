# Repository Rename Required

## Issue
The GitHub repository is currently named `Ergo_tastmaster` (with a typo), but the correct name should be `Ergo_taskmaster`.

## Current State
- Repository URL: `https://github.com/Question86/Ergo_tastmaster`
- README.md already uses the correct name: `Ergo_taskmaster`
- All documentation files use correct terminology

## Action Required
The repository owner needs to rename the GitHub repository from `Ergo_tastmaster` to `Ergo_taskmaster`.

### Steps to Rename Repository on GitHub:
1. Go to `https://github.com/Question86/Ergo_tastmaster`
2. Click on **Settings** (requires admin/owner permissions)
3. Scroll down to the "Repository name" section
4. Change the name from `Ergo_tastmaster` to `Ergo_taskmaster`
5. Click **Rename**

### After Renaming:
GitHub will automatically redirect from the old URL to the new URL, so:
- Existing clones will continue to work
- Links will automatically redirect
- All issues, PRs, and history are preserved

### For Contributors:
After the repository is renamed, contributors can update their local repository URLs with:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://github.com/Question86/Ergo_taskmaster
```

## Impact
This is a cosmetic fix with no functional impact on the code, but it ensures consistency between the repository name and the project branding.
